# Data-Structure-Projects

Time worked on: From September 2016 - December 2016

## Projects

**Playlist and Song Manager** - In this project I implemented a system that manages song and playlist objects using an array data structure. The system would allow me to create song objects that could be placed in various playlists and could be managed. 

**Department Store CMS** - This project used a linked list to implement a department store content management system. It allowed a user to maintain the inventory within a sample department store and manage their content.

**Elevator Wait Time Simulator** - This project used a queue to simulate the waiting time a person waits for an elevator. 

**Customer Support Tree** - This project used a ternary tree to implement a very basic customer support system. The tree worked similar to a decision tree in that it would take user input and classify what kind of support what be needed.

**Email CMS** - This project used an ArrayList to create a simple email management system. The project created email objects and allowed the user to store those email objects into various folders (inbox, custom folders, trash). It also allowed the user to save their information by writing the data to an object file. 



## Additional Notes

All of the listed projects were simple text based projects. At this time their has been no graphical user interface implemented but 
I might implement a graphical user interface for some of these projects in the future.
