# Data-Structure-Projects

Time worked on: From September 2016 - December 2016

## Projects

**Menu Manager** - In this project I implemented a system that manages menu item objects using an array data structure. The system would allow me to create menu items that could be placed in various menus and could be managed. 

**Trip Planner** - This project used 2 linked lists to implement a Trip Planner. It allowed a user to have 2 itineraries and the ability to create trip stops that can be added onto these itineraries.  Each itinerary has a cursor to track each trip stop and the program has the capability of cloning.

**JavaScriptFormatter** - This project used a stack to format a javascript file and then creates a edited javascript file. 

**Download Queue**- This project used a queue to simulate downloading premium and regular files.  The sizes of the files are based on random chance, but the probability of whether the file is premium or regular is put in by the user.  The download manager then prints out the simulation and ends withe the summary statement of the simulation.

**Decision Tree** - This project used a binary tree to implement a very basic decision tree.  

**Room Lookup** - This project used hashmaps to create a room lookup system.  The user inputs rooms and building within the campus hashmap.  The program then organizes all of the information and makes it easy for the user to find rooms based on specific criterias.  This program also has the capability of saving using Serializable.


## Additional Notes

All of the listed projects were simple text based projects. At this time their has been no graphical user interface implemented but 
I might implement a graphical user interface for some of these projects in the future.
